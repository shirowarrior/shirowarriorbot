# Overwatch Stats v3 ![](https://gitlab.com/lolPants/overwatch-stats/badges/master/build.svg)
_Overwatch Stats Reporting API_  

Built by [Jack Baron](https://www.jackbaron.com)

## Usage
In order to cut down on rate limiting, v3 has a caching system of sorts. This means you need to load data and then pass it to the OWStats class as a paramter. This can be done by doing:
```js
const OWStats = require('overwatch-stats')
OWStats.load('lolPants#2204')
  .then(data => {
    let stats = new OWStats(data)
    // Stats Object available for use
  })
```

## Methods
All methods return as Promises. This is for easy chaining.

---

### .getRegions()
Returns an array of available regions for the user.

### .getActiveRegion()
Returns a string of the user's most active region.  
Determined by the highest player level.

### .getData(region)
Region parameter is optional.  
If not specified, defaults to most active region.  

Returns an object with all the data you could ever want. Try it!
